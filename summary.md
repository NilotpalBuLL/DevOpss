# DevOps Task 1 Summary

I installed Ubuntu using WSL on Windows and accessed it via terminal.
I explored the Linux file system using pwd, ls, and cd.
I created and deleted directories and files using mkdir, touch, rm, and rmdir.
I edited files using nano and viewed them with cat and less.
I tested Linux permissions using chmod and ls -l.
I monitored system resources using top, df -h, and free -m.

This task helped me understand how Linux systems are managed from the command line.
